### Syntax in Computation
Casey Anderson, 2016

There are two general categories of programming languages: General-Purpose Languages (frequently abbreviated to GPL) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSL).

`Domain-Specific Languages`

`General-Purpose Languages` are written to support a wide variety of needs. In other words, languages that fall into this category are written to allow the user to make a choice regarding how they will use that particular language (example: one could make a Library database in Java, though Java was not developed specifically for libraries).

### Languages supported by MDP
* Arduino
* JavaScript
