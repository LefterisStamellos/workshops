## Syntax in Computation
Casey Anderson, 2016

There are two general categories of programming languages: General-Purpose Languages (frequently abbreviated to GPL) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSL).

### GPL vs DSL

`Domain-Specific Languages` are programming languages that are written for a specific purpose. `HTML` is a good example, as it was written exclusively for formatting text on a webpage.

`General-Purpose Languages` are written to support a wide variety of needs. In other words, languages that fall into this category are written to allow the user to write applications for a number of different contexts. For example, one could make a Library database (to keep track of who has been lent what book) in `Java`, though `Java` was not created specifically for public libraries.

### High-level vs Low-level

A `high-level` programming language is designed in part for convenience / ease of use. In general the belief is that more complex / specialized aspects of computation get in the way of focusing on your specific application, so `high-level` languages `abstract` away some of the lower-level aspects of computation. For example, you do not need to worry about the specifics of memory management when using `Python`, but cannot ignore memory management in `C`.

`High-level` programming languages are generally believed to make the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable for the average person.

A `low-level` programming language does not abstract away the nuts-and-bolts of your computer. The word "low" in this case refers to the small amount of abstraction between the language and machine language (generally machine code or assembly). In other words, you need to pay attention to more aspects of how your computer functions as a device in this style of programming. The benefit of working with languages like this is that one's programs can be incredibly small and incredibly efficient in terms of memory usage.

### Languages supported by MDP

* [NTK](http://www.netlabtoolkit.org/)
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)

MDP has carefully curated which programming languages make sense to support given the style of work in the department. Our preference has been to focus on high-level, general purpose programming languages. These languages all have a good balance between high-level functionality while also allowing one to go "lower" if necessary / desired.

### Choosing Programming Languages

Choosing which programming language is most appropriate for your specific application is not always straight-forward.
