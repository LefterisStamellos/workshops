### Syntax in Computation
Casey Anderson, 2016

There are two general categories of programming languages: General-Purpose Languages (frequently abbreviated to GPL) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSL).

`Domain-Specific Languages` are programming languages that are written for a specific purpose. `HTML` is a good example, as it was written exclusively for formatting text on a webpage.

`General-Purpose Languages` are written to support a wide variety of needs. In other words, languages that fall into this category are written to allow the user to write applications for a number of different contexts. For example, one could make a Library database (to keep track of who has been lent what book) in Java, though Java was not created specifically for libraries.

Furthermore, programming languages are generally either high-level or low-level
