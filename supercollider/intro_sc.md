[The SC Book](http://www.supercolliderbook.net/), the only official book on SC.

[SCCode](http://sccode.org/), a web-platform for sharing and remixing supercollider code.

[SCTweets](http://sctweets.tumblr.com/), supercollider code in 140 characters or less (frequently amazing).

## Download
Go [here](https://supercollider.github.io/download.html) to download SuperCollider. Once your download is complete, go ahead and install the program.

## Basics
Supercollider is at least two applications: a language interpreter and one or more synthesis servers. All communication between the lang (short for language) and the server is done via [OpenSoundControl](http://opensoundcontrol.org/).
