### pseudo-code stuff (re "teach a computer to walk")

void initialize(){
gravity;
ground;
limbs;
joints;
power;
direction.visual_sense;
visual_sense;

}

void walk( gravity = -9.8m/s2, ground = 0.0, limbNumber = 6, jointNumber = 5, food = magic, visual_sense ){
if (direction.visual_sense == 0){
direction = North;
}
else if (direction.visual_sense == 1){
direction = East;
} else if ( direction.visual_sense == 2 ){
direction = South;
} else if( direction.visual_sense == 3){
direction = West;
}

print direction;

collision_detection.visual_sense( direction ){
while direction does not change{
if (collision_detection == 0 && direction ){
move forward;
}
}

}
