### Taxonomies

Explore and analyze the Material Connexion, McMaster Carr, and Materia databases, paying special attention to the language used in each site's respective taxonomy. A taxonomy is a categorization system, but each of the above taxonomies shows one or many biases towards what is and isn't important regarding differences in material. Start by comparing the different search tools on each site. Are there ways you can look at materials in Material Connexion, for example, that are both unique to this site as well as lead to a similarly unique perspective on materiality? We will discuss your findings at the end of the 45 minute period.

### Creating Your Own Material Taxonomy

What should be included in a Field-oriented materials taxonomy? What should be excluded? Using what you gleaned through analysis from the three sample sites, construct a sample materials taxonomy that is more appropriate to field work, embedding one's self in a community, etc.. We will discuss and defend your conclusions after 30 minutes.

### Studio Scavenger Hunt

You will have 30 minutes to find an exemplary material, already in the studio, that fits your newly-created, Field-oriented taxonomy from the previous step. Come up with at least ten different uses for this material that take advantage of its unique properties. The unique properties you highlight should be reflected in your taxonomy as well. We will present and discuss as a group at the end of the 30 minute period.
